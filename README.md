This was my second project following The Odin Project curriculum, and it focused a lot more on actual Javascript coding. I found that programming the calculator logic was by far the hardest part, but the challenge of the task meant that completing it was much more rewarding. This project incorporated Javascript arrays and objects, two concepts that I'm excited to explore further. I am very happy with how this turned out, and I especially like the sleek minimalist design I was able to pull off.
